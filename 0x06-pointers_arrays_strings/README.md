Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src); This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n); The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.
